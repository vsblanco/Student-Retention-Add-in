# Student Retention Add-in

A Microsoft Excel Office Add-in that helps educators track, analyze, and follow
up with at-risk students. Pulls Master List data from Excel, generates
personalized outreach emails (via Power Automate), and integrates with the
Student Retention Kit Chrome extension.

## Architecture

The add-in has two Office runtimes plus shared code:

- **`react/`** — the visible task pane UI (React + Vite). Renders all the
  feature pages: Student View, Personalized Email, Create LDA, Settings,
  Reports, Welcome.
- **`commands/`** — the hidden long-lived "commands runtime" Office loads
  separately (`commands.html` → `background-service.js`). Handles ribbon
  button clicks, document-open events, Master List import/transfer to the
  Chrome extension, conditional formatting, and the Power Automate
  document-property poller.
- **`shared/`** — code used by both runtimes. The Chrome extension client
  singleton, sheet-name and batch-size constants, Excel helpers
  (`findColumnIndex`, `parseHyperlinkFormula`, `normalizeHeader`), and the
  single source of truth for all column aliases.

Office loads each runtime independently, so they don't share memory at
runtime — they each instantiate their own copy of the shared code.

## Setup

```bash
# Install React deps
cd react
npm install

# Install commands deps (for tests)
cd ../commands
npm install
```

## Run (development)

```bash
cd react
npm run dev          # Vite dev server for the task pane
npm run build        # Production build → react/dist/
npm run lint
```

The commands runtime has no build step — Office loads `background-service.js`
directly via ES modules from `commands.html`.

## Test

```bash
cd commands && npm test    # 205 tests covering shared utilities, column aliases, helpers
cd react   && npm test     # 48 tests covering the pure-function utility surface
```

Components themselves aren't unit-tested (they wrap `Excel.run` /
`Office.context.*` which only exist inside an Office host). Verify those
flows by sideloading the manifest into Excel.

## Deploy

Three environments, three manifests, all served from the same repo via Vercel's
per-branch deploy model:

- **Prod — `main` branch.** `https://student-retention-kit.vercel.app/`
  Auto-deployed by Vercel on every push to `main`. Sideload `manifest.prod.xml`.
- **Staging — `staging` branch.** `https://student-retention-kit-git-staging-vsblanco.vercel.app/`
  Auto-deployed by Vercel on every push to `staging`. Sideload
  `manifest.staging.xml`. Use this for "real deploy" testing before promoting
  to prod (`staging` → PR → `main`).
- **Legacy — GitHub Pages.** `https://vsblanco.github.io/Student-Retention-Add-in/`
  Still works as a fallback mirror; updated when `react/dist/` is committed
  on `main`. Sideload `manifest.xml`.

All manifests serve identical add-in functionality — only the host URLs
differ. Vercel build config lives in `vercel.json`.

### Branch model

```
feature-branch → staging (test deployed) → main (prod)
```

Feature branches off `staging` get their own automatic Vercel preview URLs but
are NOT registered in Azure AD; they're only useful via local dev or by
sideloading a one-off manifest. For full-stack testing, merge into `staging`
and use `manifest.staging.xml`.

### Azure AD configuration

Each environment's host needs **two** entries on the Azure AD app registration
(client id `71f37f39-a330-413a-be61-0baa5ce03ea3`):

1. An **Application ID URI** (`api://<host>/<client-id>`) under "Expose an API"
2. A **redirect URI** (`https://<host>/react/dist/index.html`) of type SPA under
   "Authentication"

These are already registered for `vsblanco.github.io`,
`student-retention-kit.vercel.app`, and
`student-retention-kit-git-staging-vsblanco.vercel.app`. New environments
require the same two-entry add.
